## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[CONTRIBUTING.md Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to <>.


## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [FAQ](book/FAQ.qmd).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/code-cafes-nl/cafe_playbook/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/code-cafes-nl/cafe_playbook/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.



## I Want To Contribute

There are a lot of ways to contribute to the project, our current list includes:

    • **Making bug reports** - Did you find something broken in the website?
    • **Adding to the FAQ** - Are there some questions you have had answered? Do you see some issues that have been closed with an answer that could be included here?
    • **Adding to existing playbook pages** - There's always improvements to be made and gaps to be filled!
    • **Helping to 'refactor' the book** - The book is growing and as a result the structure of it needs to be prepared 
    • **Adding to meta files** - Is the license, contribution guide, code of conduct, or references file lacking?
    • **Creating graphics** - Did you see something here that could be make clearer or nicer with an image? 
    • **Joining the talent pool** - Part of this project is about building community and providing support for new CAFEs, why not join our talent pool and present at some of these coding CAFEs?
    • **Adding presentations or linking code along sessions you have created for others to use** - Perhaps you have made some presentation for your own CAFE or a conference and think others might like to use it. Give it a license and add it directly here or provide a link for wherever it is stored. 
    • **Listing your cafe** - Are you part of one of the Netherlands growing number of coding CAFEs? Feel free to add yours to the list and link your website, it's great to see how the broader community is developing.

### Contributing through GitHub

[Git][git] is a really useful tool for version control.
[GitHub][github] sits on top of Git and supports collaborative and distributed working.

We know that it can be daunting to start using Git and GitHub if you haven't worked with them in the past, but _NES CAFE Playbook_ maintainers are here to help you figure out any of the jargon or confusing instructions you encounter!

In order to contribute via GitHub, you'll need to set up a free account and sign in.
Here are some [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/) to help you get going.
Remember that you can ask us any questions you need to along the way.

### Writing in Markdown

GitHub has a helpful page on [getting started with writing and formatting on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github).

Most of the writing that you'll do will be in [Markdown][markdown].
You can think of Markdown as a few little symbols around your text that will allow GitHub to render the text with a little bit of formatting.
For example, you could write words as **bold** (`**bold**`), or in _italics_ (`_italics_`), or as a [link][rick-roll] (`[link](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)`) to another webpage.

Also when writing in Markdown, please [start each new sentence on a new line](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/style.html#write-each-sentence-in-a-new-line-line-breaks).
Having each sentence on a new line will make no difference to how the text is displayed, there will still be paragraphs, but it makes the [diffs produced during the pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-comparing-branches-in-pull-requests) review easier to read! ✨

## Making a change with a pull request

We appreciate all contributions to the _NES CAFE Playbook_.
**THANK YOU** for helping us build this useful resource. :sparkles::star2::dizzy:

All project management, conversations and questions related to the _NES CAFE Playbook_ project happen here in the [Playbook repository][https://github.com/code-cafes-nl/cafe_playbook/].
This is also where you can contribute directly to writing or editing chapters of [the book](https://github.com/code-cafes-nl/cafe_playbook/)!

The following steps are a guide to help you contribute in a way that will be easy for everyone to review and accept with ease :sunglasses:.

### 1. Comment on an [existing issue](https://github.com/code-cafes-nl/cafe_playbook/issues) or open a new issue referencing your addition

This allows other members of the _NES CAFE Playbook_ team to confirm that you aren't overlapping with work that's currently underway and that everyone is on the same page with the goal of the work you're going to carry out.

[This blog](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) is a nice explanation of why putting this work in upfront is so useful to everyone involved.

Remember, if you open a new issue, please follow the basic guidelines laid out in _The Turing Way_ [issue template](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).
The issue template will automatically be rendered in the comment section of the new issue page so all you need to do is edit the "_Lorem ipsum_" sections.

### 2. [Fork][github-fork] [_NES CAFE Playbook_ repository][https://github.com/code-cafes-nl/cafe_playbook/]

This is now your own unique copy of the _NES CAFE Playbook_.
Changes here won't affect anyone else's work, so it's a safe space to explore edits to the code!

Make sure to [keep your fork up to date][github-syncfork] with the main repository, otherwise, you can end up with lots of dreaded [merge conflicts][github-mergeconflicts].
If you prefer working in the browser, [these instructions](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/wiki/Syncing-your-fork-to-the-original-repository-via-the-browser) describe how to sync your fork to the original repository via GitHub.

### 3. Make the changes you've discussed

Try to keep the changes focused.
If you submit a large amount of work all in one go it will be much more work for whoever is reviewing your pull request.
[Help them help you.][jerry-maguire] :wink:

While making your changes, commit often and write good, detailed commit messages.
[This blog](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) explains how to write a good Git commit message and why it matters.
It is also perfectly fine to have a lot of commits - including ones that break code.
A good rule of thumb is to push up to GitHub when you _do_ have passing tests then the continuous integration (CI) has a good chance of passing everything. 😸

If you feel tempted to "branch out" then please make a [new branch][github-branches] and a [new issue][https://github.com/code-cafes-nl/cafe_playbook/issues/new] to go with it. [This blog](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) details the different Git branching models.

Please do not re-write history!
That is, please do not use the [rebase](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-git-rebase) command to edit previous commit messages, combine multiple commits into one, or delete or revert commits that are no longer necessary.

Are you new to Git and GitHub or just want a detailed guide on getting started with version control? Check out the [Version Control chapter](https://book.the-turing-way.org/version_control/version_control.html) in _The Turing Way_ Book!

### 4. Submit a [pull request][github-pullrequest]

We encourage you to open a pull request as early in your contributing process as possible.
This allows everyone to see what is currently being worked on.
It also provides you, the contributor, feedback in real-time from both the community and the continuous integration as you make commits (which will help prevent stuff from breaking).

By filling out the "_Lorem ipsum_" sections of the pull request template with as much detail as possible, you will make it really easy for someone to review your contribution!

If you have opened the pull request early and know that its contents are not ready for review or to be merged, add "[WIP]" at the start of the pull request title, which stands for "Work in Progress".
When you are happy with it and are happy for it to be merged into the main repository, change the "[WIP]" in the title of the pull request to "[Ready for review]".

A member of the _NES CAFE Playbook_ team will then review your changes to confirm that they can be merged into the main repository.
A [review][github-review] will probably consist of a few questions to help clarify the work you've done.
Keep an eye on your GitHub notifications and be prepared to join in that conversation.

You can update your [fork][github-fork] of the _NES CAFE Playbook_ [repository][https://github.com/code-cafes-nl/cafe_playbook/] and the pull request will automatically update with those changes.
You don't need to submit a new pull request when you make a change in response to a review.

You can also submit pull requests to other contributors' branches!
Do you see an [open pull request](https://github.com/code-cafes-nl/cafe_playbook/pulls) that you find interesting and want to contribute to?
Simply make your edits on their files and open a pull request to their branch!

What happens if the continuous integration (CI) fails (for example, if the pull request notifies you that "Some checks were not successful")?
The CI could fail for a number of reasons.
At the bottom of the pull request, where it says whether your build passed or failed, you can click “Details” next to the test, which takes you to a CI run log site.
If you have the write access to the repo, you can view the log or rerun the checks by clicking the “Restart build” button in the top right.
You can learn more about CI in the [Continuous Integration chapter](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/ci.html) from _The Turing Way_!

GitHub has a [nice introduction][github-flow] to the pull request workflow, but please raise an issue if you have any questions :balloon:.


### Commit Messages

When committing changes you have made in your fork don't forget to provide context of what was changed and why. For instance, listing the issue number will help reviewers to assess changes faster.

### Reporting Bugs

Have you found a problem with the website; dead end links, spelling errors, missing images? Then you have found a bug!

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version of your browser.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. lost connection when loading the page
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [issues](https://github.com/code-cafes-nl/cafe_playbook/issues).


#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <>.


We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/code-cafes-nl/cafe_playbook/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Can you reproduce the issue?
- Include information on which browser and OS version you use
- Try to include screenshots highlighting the bug and error code
- Do you have any ideas as to what might have caused it or what could repair it?

Once it's filed:

- The _NES CAFE Playbook_ team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).
