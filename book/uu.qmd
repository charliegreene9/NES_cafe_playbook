## Who we are

The Programming Cafe at Utrecht University is an informal meet-up, where we share knowledge about programming through short presentations/demos and also help each other with challenges in working with code and data. 

The Programming Café is a ‘relaunch’ of the popular R Café external link community event that used to take place before the coronavirus outbreak. We were happy to broaden the event to include programming languages other than R.

## Who can join

Everyone is welcome at the Programming Café. We expect most attendees will be R or Python users, but users of other programming languages and software are invited as well. Attendees can be of any skill level and at any stage in working with code and data. Attendees can bring your programming problems to work on or discuss with the others. Even if you do not have an issue, you’re welcome at the Café - just to work on code or try out the exercises that have been prepared.

## Community Meetings

The Programming Café takes place on a monthly basis, and it will last about two hours (usually towards the end of the workday). Registration is not required. See the GitHub page [UtrechtUniversity/programming-cafe](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/programming-cafe) for more information.
