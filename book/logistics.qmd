# Logistics

Organizing a coding cafe requires some logistics, as for every event. However, coding cafes may come special requirements that you need to take into account. The key message of this chapter is:

> Know your audience!

## Frequency

Finding the right frequency for you as an organizer AND your community is crucial for the sustainabilty of your programming cafe. Your cafe will not be a success if you are eager to meet as often as possible, but your community consists of programmers with extremly busy schedules. Meeting too often may be exhausting for you as an organizer, and frustrating for your community as being pushed to constantly declining events may feel overwhelming. However, meeting only once in a blue moon is certainly not frequently enough to build strong bonds in your community. 

Fining the right balance is important. Try to find out what frequency may be seen as a standard for your audience and live within the rythm of your institution. You can can also reach out to partner insitutions that already have experience and ask for advice. Nothing is written in stone: you can later change the frequency based on your experience.

As a suggestion: most of our coding cafes are organized on a monthly basis with a dynamic audience. That means that some people will join most of your events while others may only come irregularily for certain topics. However, some coding cafes do not follow a strict schedule but are organized ad-hoc once there are enough speakers, topics, or volunteers.
