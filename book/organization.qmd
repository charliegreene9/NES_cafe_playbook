Building and sustaining a community around learning how to program in R requires a dedicated team of organizers who are committed to the cause. It's important to rely on a core team of organizers who can take responsibility for managing the community and ensuring that it runs smoothly. The time commitment for each organizer may be around 0.1 FTE (Full-Time Equivalent) per organizer, depending on the size and scope of the community.

Securing funding can be a challenge, but there are resources available to help. In the Netherlands, there are several Open Science programs that support initiatives like learning communities. Consider reaching out to these programs to see if they would be interested in supporting your community. You can also explore crowdfunding options or look for sponsorships from organizations that are aligned with your community's goals.

Internal communication and event planning are critical to the success of any community. It's important to have a clear and effective system for communication among organizers, including regular meetings and status updates. Consider using tools like GitHub project boards to track progress and assign tasks.

When it comes to event planning, it's important to stay organized and keep everyone informed. Make sure to have a clear plan for each event, including goals, objectives, and a timeline. Create a schedule of events and make sure to stick to it. Consider using tools like Doodle polls to help with scheduling and coordinating logistics.

In addition, there are many technology and tools available that can help you manage your community more effectively. For example, you can use Slack or Discord to communicate with members, create a website or forum to share resources and information, and use social media platforms to promote your community and attract new members.

In conclusion, building and sustaining a community around learning how to program in R requires a dedicated team of organizers, clear communication, effective event planning, and access to resources like funding and technology. By relying on a core team of organizers, securing funding from Open Science programs, and using tools like GitHub project boards and Doodle polls, you can create a thriving community that supports and inspires each other.
